# IPv4 Address Validator

This repository contains a Python script that validates IPv4 addresses using regular expressions (Regex). It also includes a set of pytest tests to ensure that the validator behaves as expected.

---

## Features

- **IPv4 Address Validation:**  
  The script checks if a given string is a valid IPv4 address. An address is considered valid if it consists of four octets separated by dots, with each octet being a number between 0 and 255.

- **Regex-Based Implementation:**  
  The validation logic is implemented using a concise and efficient regular expression that matches the criteria for IPv4 addresses.

- **Automated Testing:**  
  The repository includes tests written with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to verify the correctness of the IPv4 address validation function. This helps maintain code quality and ensures that changes do not break the intended functionality.

## Files

- **IPv4_Address.py**  
  This file contains the main implementation of the IPv4 validation function and the scriptâ€™s entry point. It reads an IPv4 address from user input and prints whether the address is valid (`True`) or not (`False`).

- **test_ipv4_address.py**  
  This file contains a series of pytest tests. The tests are designed to cover:
  - **Loopback Addresses:** e.g., "127.0.0.1" and "127.0.0.0"
  - **Modem/Private Addresses:** e.g., "192.168.6.1" and "192.168.90.1"
  - **Incorrect Addresses:** e.g., "10.10.10.10.10", "256.0.0.1", and "254.0.765.1"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- **pytest:** Install pytest for running tests. You can install it using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

### Running the Script

To run the IPv4 address validator, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python IPv4_Address.py
```

You will be prompted to enter an IPv4 address. The script will output `True` if the address is valid and `False` otherwise.

### Running the Tests

To run the automated tests, simply run:

```bash
pytest test_ipv4_address.py
```

pytest will discover the tests and display the results, ensuring that all cases pass as expected.

## Code Overview

### IPv4_Address.py

- **validate(ip: str) -> bool:**  
  This function uses a regular expression to check whether the input string is a valid IPv4 address. The regex ensures:
  - There are exactly four numeric segments.
  - Each segment is between 0 and 255.
  
- **main():**  
  The main function that prompts the user for an IPv4 address, calls the validation function, and prints the result.

### test_ipv4_address.py

- **Test Functions:**  
  The tests include:
  - `test_LoopBack()`: Verifies loopback addresses.
  - `test_ModemAddress()`: Checks typical private IP addresses.
  - `test_WrongAddress()`: Confirms that improperly formatted or out-of-range addresses return `False`.
